# Real_Estate_Model

Overview
This GitHub repository contains a Machine Learning model for predicting house prices based on a set of features. The model goes through various steps, including data collection, data importation, data analysis, feature selection, correlation analysis, data visualization, and the creation of a predictive pipeline. It also addresses the handling of missing values and prepares the final model for use by a real estate company for predicting house prices.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python (3.6+)
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Data Collection
The first step in this project involves collecting real estate data. The dataset may be obtained from various sources such as public datasets, web scraping, or an internal database.

Data Importation
Data collected is imported into a Jupyter notebook environment using libraries like Pandas. The dataset is then loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the data. This includes checking data types, summary statistics, and initial data cleaning.

Feature Selection
We identify the most promising attributes (features) that are likely to have a significant impact on house prices.

Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis helps us understand the relationships between features and identify multicollinearity.

Data Visualization
Data is visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative graphs and plots that help in better understanding the data.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves dealing with missing values, handling outliers, and transforming data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Model Development
A predictive model is built using Scikit-Learn. This model predicts house prices based on the selected features.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared) to assess its accuracy and reliability.

Deployment
The trained model is deployed and made available for use by a real estate company for predicting house prices.

Usage
To use this Real Estate Model, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries mentioned in the Jupyter notebook.
Open the Jupyter notebook and run it.
Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to collect, preprocess, and train the model.
Use the trained model to predict house prices for a set of features.
